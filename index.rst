What's with the name?
----------------------

Originally Kong was called paradigm, because it was going to change the way we thought about deployment. After much convincing from coworkers that this was too enterprisey, during the Djangocon 09 sprints, I was given the name Donkey Kong. I thought it would be a fun play on words to name a project django kong, because it sounds like Djangocon, and it plays off of Donkey Kong. Then I just needed to find a way to associate Kong with what the project actually does, because it's a Deployment Testing Tool for King/Donkey Kong sized sites.
